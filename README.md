# Frontend Mentor - Social link-sharing profile

This is a solution to the [Social link-sharing profile from Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS).

The challenge was to build out a social links profile and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

This project does not require JavaScript.
